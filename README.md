# 🎨 Maxwell’s Color Mixing Wheel – Interactive Physics Simulation

An interactive educational tool that simulates James Clerk Maxwell’s famous color disc experiment — demonstrating **additive color mixing** using red, green, and blue segments on a spinning wheel.

This simulation shows how different proportions of colored light blend into new colors when rotated rapidly. It’s the same principle used in screens, projectors, and how our eyes perceive digital color.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Select any target color via a color picker
- 🌈 Automatically calculates RGB (and optionally brightness) proportions
- ⚙️ Choose between 12 or 48 segment layouts
- 🌀 Adjust spin speed to simulate different viewing conditions
- 🖨️ Print a physical 12 cm color wheel for offline experiments
- 🔲 Optional brightness correction adds white/black based on lightness

## 🧠 How It Works

The disc is divided into segments based on the RGB composition of the chosen color. When the wheel spins, the segments blur together and your eyes perceive the *average* of the light, creating the illusion of a single, mixed color.  

This demonstrates how digital screens and the human visual system process color through **additive mixing** of light.
