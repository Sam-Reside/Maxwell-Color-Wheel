# Maxwell-Color-Wheel
This project is a browser-based simulation inspired by James Clerk Maxwellâ€™s famous color mixing experiments. It demonstrates how spinning a segmented disc of red, green, and blue can produce a wide range of colors through additive color mixing, the same principle used in screens and projectors today.
